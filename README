========

Copyright (C) 2014  Atanas Georgiev

This application enables the volume knob 
on the Asus Xonar U1 USB sound card to be used with Linux.
You can increase and decrease the volume by rotating the knob
or mute the sound by pushing it.
A volume bar is shown when you change the volume. 

When you connect Xonar U1 device,
the application will automatically set it as default sound card.
When you unplug it, your other (integrated) sound card will be set as default.

'xonaru1service' communicates with Xonar U1 thru 'xonaru1d'.
'xonaru1d' must be running for 'xonaru1service' to operate.
